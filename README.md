# Urbit Constitution client module



## Install

#### `npm install urbit-constitution-client --save`



## Test

#### `npm test`



## Important things to know

There are three categories of Urbit ships: galaxies, stars, and planets. Galaxies spawn stars. Stars spawn planets.

Each Urbit ship has a unique integer address. Galaxy addresses are numbered 0 - 255 (2^8). Star addresses are numbered 256 - 65,535 (2^16). Planet addresses are numbered 65,536 - 4,294,967,295 (2^32).

Each Urbit ship also has a unique human-readable name that's determined from its address.



## Validation and Formatting Functions


#### `toAddress(shipName)`

## Command Line Example

### Get a random spawn candidate for a ship you own and then spawn it 

#### 1. Call `getSpawnCandidate` passing in the Urbit address of a ship you own 
```
node -pe 'require("./index").getSpawnCandidate(256)'
```

Note that because this function doesn't use a callback this command uses the `-pe` flag in order to print the returned value. Most of the functions have callbacks, so their commands use the `-e` flag and `console.log` as the final parameter
#### Returned value
`791085312`

This function is a random number generator, so returned values will vary



#### 2. Call `doSpawn` with the returned spawn candidate address
`node -e 'require("./index").doSpawn(791085312,console.log)'`
#### Returned object
```
{ 
  error: false,
  rawTx: 
    '{
